# Progress

## Rename: Sawt → Nutq

The project was originally named Sawt and has been renamed to Nutq (نطق, "utterance"). The
rename was necessary, not cosmetic: "Sawt" collided with the name of an existing funded
startup. Nutq was chosen as a replacement that keeps the same conceptual thread (an Arabic
word for the act of speaking/uttering) without the collision.

## Phase 1: client-side pipeline

Phase 1 built the full client-side voice pipeline described in
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md):

- Microphone capture
- Local Moonshine STT (WASM, in-browser)
- Real wiring to ZeroClaw's `/ws/chat` WebSocket
- Web Speech API TTS for playback of the agent's reply

As of today (2026-09-02), the first full live end-to-end voice test succeeded: mic in,
transcription, agent round-trip over `/ws/chat`, and spoken reply out, all working together
against the local ZeroClaw test backend.

## How the working end-to-end test was reached

Getting to a working test surfaced several distinct issues, each worth remembering since
they're not obvious from the code alone:

- **Pairing-token confusion.** Early connection attempts used the 6-digit `get-paircode`
  value as the `/ws/chat` bearer token. This doesn't work; the endpoint checks a long-lived
  `zc_<64hex>` token instead. The failure mode was a plain WebSocket `code=1006` close with no
  further detail, which is actually an HTTP 401 that the browser's WebSocket API doesn't
  surface. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full explanation.
- **Stale container after config changes.** `docker compose restart` does not pick up changes
  to the compose file or to mounted config/volumes. Plain `docker compose up -d` picks up
  compose-file changes. Changes to `config.toml` or other mounted volume content require
  `docker compose up -d --force-recreate`. Debugging against a stale container that looked
  like it had been updated but hadn't cost real time here.
- **Silent daemon logging.** The zeroclaw daemon prints nothing beyond a startup banner to
  stdout, so `docker logs` looked clean while things were actually failing. The real errors
  were only visible in `/zeroclaw-data/.zeroclaw/data/state/runtime-trace.jsonl`, discovered
  by digging into the container's filesystem rather than trusting `docker logs`.
- **Model field parsing bug.** The `config.toml` field for the Anthropic model under
  `[providers.models.anthropic.<alias>]` writes correctly but reads back as `<unset>` from
  the daemon's own config reader. Worked around by setting the model via the
  `ZEROCLAW_providers__models__anthropic__default__model` environment variable instead, the
  same mechanism already known to work for `api_key`.
- **Accidental API key exposure.** An API key was briefly echoed in plaintext output when
  running `docker compose config` (which resolves and prints the fully-interpolated compose
  configuration, env vars included). The key was rotated immediately once this was noticed.

## Post-test cleanup

Once the end-to-end test succeeded, the following cleanup was done and each item was
verified directly against the running daemon via `docker exec zeroclaw zeroclaw config get`
rather than assumed from what was written to `config.toml`:

- `RUST_LOG=debug` removed (was set temporarily for the runtime-trace debugging above).
- `require_pairing` re-enabled to `true` (its default, per
  [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)).
